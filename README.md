# Fuel Characteristics and Properties Calculator

This project focuses on calculating and analyzing the properties of two types of fuel using a web-based application. It features two main classes: `FuelCalculator` and `MazutCalculator`, which implement principles of object-oriented and functional programming to process input data and display results on a web page.

## Features
- **Fuel Calculation**: Calculates key parameters such as the composition of dry and combustible mass, transition coefficients, and lower heating values for different fuel types.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: The `FuelCalculator` and `MazutCalculator` classes ensure maintainable and extendable code for handling different fuel characteristics.
- **User Interface**: A web-based interface allows users to input fuel data and view the calculated results directly on the page.

## Technologies Used
- HTML/CSS for the web interface
- JavaScript for handling input/output
- Python for backend calculations (if applicable)

## How to Use
1. Input the fuel data in the provided web form.
2. The application processes the data using the developed classes and displays the results.

This project is ideal for those interested in fuel properties and showcases the integration of web development with object-oriented programming for scientific calculations.
